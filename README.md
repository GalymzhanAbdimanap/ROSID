## ROSID: Remote Sensing Satellite Data for Oil Spill Detection on Land


The ROSID dataset, designed for detecting onshore oil spills, is based on Landsat satellite imagery. It includes original images with 7 channels and corresponding annotations in GeoTIFF format. 
Additionally, the dataset provides extracted images in RGB format, using channels 7 (SWIR), 4 (NIR), and 3 (Red). 
The dataset is structured similarly to the Cityscapes format and can be downloaded via the provided link and the password is : **P@ssw0rd_ROSID2024$**:

## Description
The dataset used 123 images from the Landsat satellite for the period 2006-2008, with a spatial resolution of 30 meters and a bandwidth of 185 km,
obtained using 7 spectral channels. The dataset contains 9 classes, and the table below presents the list of these classes along with the corresponding number of pixels for each.

| No  | Class name  | Number of Pixels |
| --- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| 1   | oil         | 131 435           |
| 2   | cloud       | 157 338           |
| 3   | shadow      | 74 016            |
| 4   | water       | 18 767            |
| 5   | urban       | 4 020             |
| 6   | soil        | 4 739 347         |
| 7   | vegetation  | 2 775             |
| 8   | look-alike  | 3 731             |
| 9   | background  | 7 720 389         |

# ROSID Train
The ```segmentation``` folder contains files for training and testing the ROCID dataset for semantic segmentation.

We used the  [MMSegmentation](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation)  to train the model.

**Step 0.** Download and install Miniconda from the [official website](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

**Step 1.** To train a model on our dataset, you need to install mmsegmentation, here you will find the [installation instructions](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation/blob/master/docs/en/get_started.md). 

**Step 2.** Open the mmsegmentation folder and distribute the files in our repository into folders. 

## Preprocessing
**Step 3.** Divide the dataset into 320x320 pixel fragments with a 106-pixel overlap, and split it into training, validation, and testing sets.
```shell
python create_data_320_320.py
```

**Step 4.** Ð¡hange the dataset path in the file ```configs/_base_/datasets/oil_spill_320_320.py``` on your way which you will receive as a result of previous step. 

## Train
```shell
python tools/train.py configs/mask2former/mask2former_r50_8xb2-90k_cityscapes-512x1024.py
```

## Test
```shell
python tools/test.py configs/mask2former/mask2former_r50_8xb2-90k_cityscapes-512x1024.py work_dirs\mask2former_r50_8xb2-90k_cityscapes-512x1024\iter_40000.pth
```
